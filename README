QCircuit is an aid for understanding, designing, and simulating quantum circuits. You essentially drag-and-drop gates into place on a set of "wires" and see its effects. Currently implements the Hadamard and Not/CNot/Toffoli/etc. gates, as well as allowing you to define a gate with an arbitrary (2^n)x(2^n) complex matrix. You can feed input bits in one end of a circuit and watch the values change as they continue through the circuit, as well as retrieving the actual quantum state at any given point.

If you don't want to read the help first, just note that holding control is frequently used to group actions.

Also, the repo has a folder, "generated," which has a number of sample files generated by the program. Read the help for info on the extensions.
